-   [Neuroscience](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_neuroscience "History of neuroscience"): In [Ancient Greece](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greece "Ancient Greece"), interest in the brain began with the work of [Alcmaeon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcmaeon_of_Croton "Alcmaeon of Croton"), who appeared to have dissected the eye and related the brain to vision. He also suggested that the brain, not the heart, was the organ that ruled the body (what Stoics would call the *hegemonikon*) and that the senses were dependent on the brain. According to ancient authorities, Alcmaeon believed the power of the brain to synthesize sensations made it also the seat of memories and thought. The author of *[On the Sacred Disease](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_the_Sacred_Disease "On the Sacred Disease")*, part of the Hippocratic corpus, likewise believed the brain to be the seat of intelligence. The debate regarding the *hegemonikon* persisted among ancient Greek philosophers and physicians for a very long time. Already in the 4th century BC, [Aristotle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristotle "Aristotle") thought that the heart was the seat of intelligence, while the brain was a cooling mechanism for the blood. He reasoned that humans are more rational than the beasts because, among other reasons, they have a larger brain to cool their hot-bloodedness. On the opposite end, during the [Hellenistic period](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hellenistic_period "Hellenistic period"), [Herophilus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herophilos "Herophilos") and [Erasistratus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erasistratus "Erasistratus") of Alexandria engaged in studies that involved [dissecting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissection "Dissection") human bodies, providing evidence for the primacy of the brain. They affirmed the distinction between the [cerebrum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebrum "Cerebrum") and the [cerebellum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebellum "Cerebellum"), and identifying the [ventricles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventricular_system "Ventricular system") and the *[dura mater](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dura_mater "Dura mater")*. Their works are now mostly lost, and we know about their achievements due mostly to secondary sources. Some of their discoveries had to be re-discovered a millennium after their death. During the [Roman Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Empire "Roman Empire"), the Greek physician and philosopher [Galen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galen "Galen") dissected the brains of [oxen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ox "Ox"), [Barbary apes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbary_macaque "Barbary macaque"), swine, and other non-human mammals. He concluded that, as the cerebellum was denser than the brain, it must control the [muscles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle "Muscle"), while as the cerebrum was soft, it must be where the senses were processed. Galen further theorized that the brain functioned by the movement of animal spirits through the ventricles. He also noted that specific spinal nerves controlled specific muscles, and had the idea of the reciprocal action of muscles. Only in the 19th century, in the work of [François Magendie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fran%C3%A7ois_Magendie "François Magendie") and [Charles Bell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Bell "Charles Bell"), would the understanding of [spinal function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinal_cord "Spinal cord") surpass that of Galen.

-   Odometer: Odometer, a device used in the late Hellenistic time and by Romans for indicating the distance travelled by a vehicle. It was invented sometime in the 3rd century BC. Some historians attribute it to Archimedes, others to Heron of Alexandria. It helped revolutionize the building of roads and travelling by them by accurately measuring distance and being able to carefully illustrate this with a milestone.
-   [Optical telegraph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_telegraph "Optical telegraph"): In the 9th century, during the Arab--Byzantine wars, the Byzantine Empire used a system of beacons to transmit messages from the border with the Abbasid Caliphate across Asia Minor to the Byzantine capital, Constantinople.The main line of beacons stretched over some 450 miles (720 km). In the open spaces of central Asia Minor, the stations were placed over 60 miles (97 km) apart, while in [Bithynia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bithynia "Bithynia"), with its more broken terrain, the intervals were reduced to ca. 35 miles (56 km). Based on modern experiments, a message could be transmitted the entire length of the line within an hour. The system was reportedly devised in the reign of Emperor Theophilos (ruled 829--842) by [Leo the Mathematician](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leo_the_Mathematician "Leo the Mathematician"), and functioned through two identical water clocks placed at the two terminal stations, Loulon and the Lighthouse. Different messages were assigned to each of twelve hours, so that the lighting of a [bonfire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bonfire "Bonfire") on the first beacon on a particular hour signalled a specific event and was transmitted down the line to Constantinople.
-   [Olympic Games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games "Olympic Games"): The ancient Olympic Games (Ὀλυμπιακοὶ ἀγῶνες; Latin: Olympia, neuter plural: "the Olympics") were a series of athletic competitions among representatives of city-states and one of the Panhellenic Games of Ancient Greece.
